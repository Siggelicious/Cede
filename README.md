# Cede
 A light-weight addon to help you track CDs for 2.4.3, seeks to emulate Omnibar. 
 
 ## Installation
 Download the addon from https://github.com/Siggelicious/Cede.
 Rename the folder from 'Cede-master' to 'Cede'.
 Drag it into your `...\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` folder.

## Options
You can change the scale of the buttons aswell as the vertical offset by going into Interface > AddOns > Cede.
You can add or remove CDs with ``/cede <add, remove> <id> <cd>``.
If you end up with green or broken icons it's likely because you have two IDs for the same spell.
